# Crystal-Growth
Goal: Make a crystal generator using principles of DLA

I aim to "simulate" the principles of diffusion limited aggregation to create a random fractal pattern. The update history is limited since I started making this in Jupyter notebook before getting on Github. Fear of deleting important things became a nightmare, so here I am.

This is very light on the science, and more of a programming exercise mixed with unfinished business. I started this project several years ago in school and decided to return to it (aka start over). I didn't get it to where I wanted it because I was a noob. Now I'm a little less of a noob.
